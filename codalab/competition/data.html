<h3>Data links</h3>

<p>
	Data for the competition is available on
	<a href="https://git.atilf.fr/tmickus/codwoe/-/tree/master/data">our git
	repository</a>. The complete datasets will be	made available at the end of the
	evaluation phase (January 31st).
</p>

<h3>Data format & contents</h3>
<p>
	All datasets are in JSON format. We minimize whitespace for memory consumption
	purposes. Trial, training and development datasets for both definition
	modeling and reverse dictionary tracks are shared: as the two tasks are
	converse tasks, the	source for either one is the target of the other. Test
	datasets will be	distinct, and have no overlap between the two tracks.
</p>
<p>
	Datasets are available for the five following languages: EN, ES, FR, IT, RU.
	Datasets are distinct per languages. All five languages contain embeddings for
	two distinct types of architectures: "char" (character-based embeddings) and
	"sgns" (word2vec Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling). EN, FR and RU have in
	addition a third type of embedding available, namely "electra"
	(Transformer-based contextual embeddings).
</p>
<p>
	All embeddings for any given language were trained on the same corpus;
	embedding training corpora across languages were designed to be comparable.
	All computation details will be provided in the task description paper.
</p>
<p>
	The trial dataset is annotated much more richly than the other datasets.
	During the shared task, we will only provide gloss, id and embeddings. After
	the evaluation phase, we will provide complete datasets, which will also
	include the word being defined and its part of speech.
</p>
<p>
	We very strongly encourage participants to reserve the trial dataset for
	running manual evaluations of their systems' production. The presence of a
	manual evaluation in system descriptions will be taken into account during the
	reviewing process and discussed in the task paper.
